# differential-space
Differential Space is a minimalist turn-based space strategy game I made for my video series.

## How do I play this?

You'll need two windows, one to launch the server and the other to launch the client.

### Launch the Server
1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). Remember to add GOPATH to your PATH.
1. Build and launch the server.

   ```
   go install differential-space.go && differential-space
   ```
   
### Launch the Client
